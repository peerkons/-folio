What is your passion?


"Travelling, without doubt.

Seeing the world is as possible and inexpensive as ever. You can always read

another book or attend a better school, but theory will never compare to the real,
eye-opening experience.

It is also one of the reasons I study international business. As jobs become more
flexible, we will soon be able to work from anywhere on the planet - while eating
paella with the locals in Barcelona, walking with elephants in Phuket or exploring
volcanoes throughout Hawaii. Just have to work smart (and hard) enough to be part
of that."
