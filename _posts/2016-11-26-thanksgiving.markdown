Coming together, telling stories, and showing each other gratitude. These are the main values of Thanksgiving. Of course RBS shares all of them!
The Thanksgiving event today was a blast! We must thank all of you for making the atmosphere as great as it was and the pies tastier than we could have ever imagined.

Thank you Daniels Neguliners for saving these moments.

Until next year!
