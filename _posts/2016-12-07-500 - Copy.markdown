How to stay positive during a stress-filled week of studies?

"Build resilience and develop agility;
Assess value, prioritize;
Notice opportunities;
Attract good energy;
Never back down;
At all times be kind.
= 
Have control over your life;
Always make room for what makes you happy;
Please smile more and laugh often;
Practice 5P's: Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance.

Yearn for more,
Feed your brain,
Rest well,
Use your brain,
Invest in yourself,
Train your brain."
