It is a new semester and everyone's schedules are about to be filled more than a gym straight after New Year. With the structure in place, one of the Student Union's resolutions is working on improving the transparency of the organisation. We wanted to look back at last semester and see what has been accomplished by us. Furthermore, we want to inform you on our current plans for the future, and we want to make regular updates on what we are doing. This is the first newsletter of the Student Union of Riga Business School with many more to come.

(*calm before the storm*)



We could say that the semester started with planning and making sure that the BBA5's have the time of their lives, of course right after a good morning run to wake up.





Three days of fun, joy, and some sports also went by everyone very swiftly. We went orienteering, had some friendly competitions, and even learned while we were at it. The days in Cēsis left everlasting smiles on our faces. 





<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/bc2.jpg" alt="bonding camp" title="bonding camp" style="width: 100%">

(*everyone left with happy faces*)



After welcoming the newest faces in RBS, we started our studies. After a not so long period of time, September 23 came, and with it - the first General Meeting. We introduced ourselves and explained the basics of the SU.

(*first open meetings were a success with much initiative taken from the students*)



Having introduced ourselves, it was time to start working. The four divisions of the Student Union soon had their first open meetings, where bright people came to help this university become a better place for everyone.





Many enthusiasts came together and shared their ideas and improvements that would bring RBS to the next level!





Of course, we also wanted to make sure that you are satisfied also outside of university time, so we opened the bridge club and basketball trainings - allowing you to have some quality time networking while also breaking some sweat.





At the beginning of October, our own Santa from group of people who are working on their Double Degrees in Oslo came to inform you about the possibilities and options of following in her footsteps and going for one year to study in the far land of Norway.

And with October, came two very important events.



The Elections of 2016 and the Olympics against SSE Riga.



<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/og1.jpg" alt="Olympics" title="Olympics" style="width: 100%">

(*Will Šmits make us proud or drown?*)



First and foremost - the games would be nothing without our own Romāns Galaiko working the hardest of everyone, making sure that no sport is left unseen.



<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/og2.jpg" alt="Olympics" title="Olympics" style="width: 100%">

(*Romāns making the most out of the game*)



We fought bravely all days, finally, with our Basketball superstars taking the final win, we ended the games with a tie against SSE Riga. 4 against 4 was the final score, with our courageous soldiers winning in Basketball, Football, Bridge, and Table Tennis.



Most importantly, we all had a great time while we were at it.

(*A happy team at the end of the Games*)





And so the Games were over, but a new competition was soon to start - the Elections.





As a new tradition, also livestreamed and hosted by the man himself - Romāns, the elections were more popular than those of USA at the time. With most of the positions being elected, most of our new board started their work already at the end of the same week, when the results were announced.

(*The old and new boards*)



With the elections over, the new board stepped in.

We want to thank the previous board for their continuous efforts and hard work put into the Union.



The President - Elvijs Dobelnieks

Vice President - Maria Babuškina

Head of External - Romāns Galaiko

Head of Culture - Agnese Kazāka

Head of Education - Santa Kanaška

Head of PR - Kārlis Jonāss





And so, the new members stepped in:



The President - Andris Zābers

Vice President - Artur Burbo

Head of External - Paula Polačenko

Head of Culture - Edvarts Emersons

Head of PR - Pauls Pērkons

later - Head of Education - Rolands Indruškevics





The new team is working to make sure our university becomes better by the day.



Now we will go over what each part of the board has done and will work on in the near future.





For the presidential couple, the first two months were full of ambitious planning and hard working to deliver upon the promises made during the election period. As the president states, "I can say that this time has been as rewarding as it has been challenging".  We would like to take the possibility to briefly reflect on the key areas of improvements during this period.

(*Our president - Anris, a man of the people*)





1)	Increasing transparency. 





To start building and achieving our long term goals, first and foremost we had to make sure that everybody knows what the Student Union is doing and how they can get involved. At the very beginning we organized the “introductory week” where everyone interested was able to attend the division meetings and find out the one they fit the most.  However, to keep informed also the ones who were not so keen to participate from the beginning, we published a calendar whereby everyone can see the meeting rhythm and events organized by us.

Moreover, he states, "I can proudly mention that the Student Union finally has started working on our own webpage which will serve as a great tool for communication".

2)	Becoming a valuable partner to the school’s administration. 





Here at the Student Union we strongly believe that our job is not only to create parties and have fun, but do our best to assist the school’s administration with our help in order to increase the academic standards and performance of the school! We have already met with the school`s administration on several occasions and expressed the concerns of the students regarding academic issues. Together with the Academic Division we are working on report about the issues and challenges identified with the study process, which will be conveyed to the school’s administration in the early January.  In that way it will be ensured that the voice of students is heard! 





3)	Strengthening the RBS Community. 





The most important goal of the Student Union has and will always be strengthening our community, which undoubtedly is our greatest asset.  This year, he says, "I have made it a personal goal to involve not only the BBA students, but also the MBA's and Alumni". We have already met with two MBA students to discuss the cooperation possibilities and models which we intend to start implementing starting from this semester. As for the Alumni Association – the contact has been established between our boards and from the Student Union`s side we have sent them draft of our cooperation possibilities which we see as the most beneficial for both parties.  Further actions are supposed to be taken during January! 





The external division has also been busy in these last months.





With help from the Public Relations division, the new proposal has been created for approaching companies for events and overall collaboration.





With the templates ready, they formed the main vision and guidelines for the further operations of the division. Ones of these were making sure that everyone is satisfied in the events that happened last semester. 





<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/w1.jpg" alt="Workshop" title="Workshop" style="width: 100%">

(*External division filling the stomachs of our listeners*)





With the division's continuous efforts, they negotiated companies such as Pernes Longchips, Lipton, Babolat, Isostar, & Dailes Theatre as sponsors of the SU's events.





<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/t1.jpg" alt="Tennis" title="Tennis" style="width: 100%">

(*Our Head of Culture quenching his thirst*)





Only with the help of External division, we are able to visit LATBAN's investment sessions and learn more about pitching from watching others do it.





Furthermore, they started their negotiations with the possible general sponsor of the Student Union - Citadele bank, which, unfortunately, did not go through.





<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/b3.jpg" alt="Board" title="Board" style="width: 100%">

(*Our Head of the External division - Paula, ready for new challenges*)





What is more, they started the initial preparations for making sure that the division is ready for the upcoming events of 2017.







We want to remind you, that the full event plan is publicly visible in the following part of our website.



<a href="http://studentunion.co/timeline.html">Event Timeline</a>



The main event plan for which this division is preparing for is as following:



- February 9 - CV Workshop



	This workshop will allow attendants to learn how to correctly write a CV, and what an employer looks for in a CV. This is one of the preparation events for upcoming events, such as the Career fair and Networking dinner.



- February 23 - Career fair



	The Career fair educates us, youngsters, about internship or work opportunities.



- March - External workshop



	This workshop will widen your horizons on internship options in the future, and will allow to learn from BBA alumnus, and RBS MBA students, as well as a speaker from a local company.



- End of April - Beer & Business



	Beer & Business - as the name states, it is an informal event for usually formal people. The event will take place here in RBS, and is in the form of a grill party together with both the BBA's and MBA's of RBS - some quality networking, with some quality cold beer.





<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/w2.jpg" alt="Workshop" title="Workshop" style="width: 100%">

(*Knowledge is power*)





As it is already visible, the external division's main goals are educating students about internship possibilities, as well as connecting us with possible mentors, business partners, employers, or possibly even more.





The Culture division makes sure that RBS improves the lives of international students, organizes events, and overall makes our all more cultural.





<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/b6.jpg" alt="Board" title="Board" style="width: 100%">

(*Our Head of the Culture division - Edvarts, bringing culture into our little family*)





RBS SU has been the key player in organizing Bachelor student social life during the school time, but none of that would have been achievable without cooperative synergy in between the divisions, students and faculty.





<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/gtg1.jpg" alt="Get Together" title="Get Together" style="width: 100%">

(*The beginning of our little BBA family*)





The culture division is mainly responsible for making events such as the BBA Get Together, or the Welcoming Party possible.

They made our Thanksgiving Day a day to be cherished and our Christmas full of miracles. There have been many events and many bright moments in these last months and we really look forward to the future plans.



The event plan is available in the Event Timeline section of the webpage.



For the upcoming semester division have some big plans regarding the inner culture of students. One of the goals for the future is bringing in MBA students into the student life of RBS. We are going to work on internal issues that students cause or have in school, for an example, leaving dinning stuff at the kitchen or mocking up the classes. To connect society of RBS, we are planning to have a sports event for both BBA and MBA students in late January.  Afterwards the division will cooperate with RTU EVF to deliver an orienteering event for students. Most interesting events for us will be the Sports games in May, when our students will have an opportunity to bond, network, and show their best athletic skills. 





The Education division has always been like a dark horse in RBS. 





<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/b4.jpg" alt="Board" title="Board" style="width: 100%">

(*Our Head of the Education division - Rolands, hearing out the students' pleas for help*)





Rolands, the head of the division states, "The education division is usually the hidden part of the iceberg of the Student Union. Nevertheless, there are many meaningful objectives that the division has determined to face this year."



First of all, the division listed implementing the Russian language course as one of the priorities, which, according to the data from the survey, seems that will be developed.





The aim is to create the course both for beginners and students with more advanced skills. To maximize the gain, the course should be intense, hard, saturated and led by a knowledgeable teacher. If all goes as planed, the course should start with the next learning year. 





<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/chupagif.gif" alt="Cheers" title="Cheers" style="width: 100%">

(*everybody cheers*)





Many great proposals have come from students regarding computer lab. The education division will work on them to make the course more intense and meaningful. We need to eliminate the insignificant, make deficiencies effective, and change boring to valuable. 





Regarding the demand of BBA5 students on 19.01. in collaboration with External division, the Internship workshop will be created. During this event BBA student’s will present their internship experiences to encourage and guide our new peers towards their summer break challenges. 





Between many other plans, we are currently working on teacher evaluation, because the division believes that the advises and criticisms of students do not reach the professors, therefore, lacking improvements. 





As a matter of fact, "we are still looking forward to volunteers willing to see change", mentions Rolands, especially from BBA 5. Help us sustain the pride, reputation and future of RBS. 





The final division that makes sure you reach us is the Public Relations division.





<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/b5.jpg" alt="Board" title="Board" style="width: 100%">

(*Our Head of the PR division - Pauls, making sure our visions are your future*)





The PR division's main goals of last semester have been supporting other divisions, spreading the word of the Student Union, increasing our transparency, and creating a stable structure which can be passed on to our following boards.





Other than managing our social media pages and ensuring that all events reach the students, we continued working on the structure of the division and our visual identity. We continued the work, started by the previous head of PR - Kārlis, and finished most of the brand book, which lists the basics of our visual identity that would be passed on for future generations.





Outside of our brand, we wanted to make sure that the companies we approach, see us as a valuable partner. The perception we give of ourselves is key in that, therefore, our new proposals were created.

Finally, we had and still have two main goals our division sees. These are merchandise and the improvement of transparency. At the end of the year, with the initiative from the division we started the sales of the RBS bottle (*Which you can order either through Facebook or our website's Merchandise section*).





The second goal is increasing the transparency of what we do here - in the Student Union.





The first step in doing so, was providing a platform, where information that is relevant to our students is available.





With that though in mind, <a href="http://studentunion.co/">This Website</a>  was created.





Through the website of the SU, people can follow up on the event or meeting plan, as well as read the newsletters of the SU, to see what has happened, what will happen, or suggest, what YOU want to happen!





The division's main goal for next year is continuing on improving the webpage and the transparency of the Union, increasing the awareness of our Union, and forming, nurturing, and improving our bond between BBA's and MBA's of the University



This was the first Newsletter of the Student Union of Riga Business School.



We remind you that you can all take initiative by contacting us and either joining our team or suggesting improvements. Joining the Student Union is not only a great line in you CV, but also a very valuable experience for your future career, which will definitely pay back sevenfold.





Thank you for the amazing community.

Student Union Out!
