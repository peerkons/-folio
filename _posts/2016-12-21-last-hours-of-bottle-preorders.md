A reminder for everyone - today is the last day for the RBS Bottle preorders.

(You can order the bottle by:
<br>• Writing us on Facebook
<br>• Messaging any of the board members
<br>• Writing us at student.union@rbs.lv
<br>• At www.studentunion.co/merchandise )

However, even if you can't make it by the end of today, no one should drink their favorite Christmas drink from a regular plastic cup.

Therefore, we are kind enough to offer you the bottle for 10 Eur tomorrow at the Christmas party, before it goes on sale for the full price (12 Eur).

See you at the party! We are completely flipping out about it!
