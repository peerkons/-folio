After a bit more than two weeks, the Research Director of the Certus Think-Tank will be the Keynote speaker of the Networking Dinner.

Growing Wisely is not only a widely spoken topic within our community, but Latvia as well. 
Dr. Auers will speak about Latvia's potential economical future and how we can achieve meaningful growth as a nation.
Dr. Auers will make sure that the educational part of the evening will stay and we will not only gain contacts but knowledge as well.

If you have yet to register for the Dinner, it is the last time to do so. Contact the Student Union on Facebook or student.union@rbs.lv for more information.
