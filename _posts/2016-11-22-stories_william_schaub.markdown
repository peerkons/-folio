"I wish I had understood the importance of auditing. 

I was an auditor in Ernst&Young for two years after graduating from university and did not enjoy it at all, because that meant retracing the work of other people and obliging them to do it right. So, I wish to have respected and appreciated it more since now, looking back on auditing and other auditors, I have great respect for them."
