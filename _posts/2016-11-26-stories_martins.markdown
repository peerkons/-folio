What motivates you in your studies?

"The fact that I'm doing this for myself.
I'm not studying for the diploma or for the grades, I'm studying to become a successful businessman. 
When my motivation is not working, my coursemates are the ones who help me get back on track."

-Mārtiņš Šmits,
BBA student
