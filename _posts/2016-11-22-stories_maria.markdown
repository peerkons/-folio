Being a professional dancer sure requires confidence and courage. 
How do these capabilities help a young woman in the business world?


"Entrepreneurial confidence is derived from the ability to execute, just like a dancer gains self-assurance by practicing.

However, no matter how confident you are, sometimes all of us feel doubt. This is where courage comes in - it requires taking risk and ignoring that fearful voice in your head. Feel the fear and do it anyway. Otherwise - just stay at home."
