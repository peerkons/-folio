Our Student Union Facebook page has reached 500 likes.

This is a great milestone and starting point for us - a union only 5 years old. 

We hope our house keeps growing in the following years and our community builds the path for further progress.

Thank you, everyone who has been with us up to now, the work doesn't end, it just gets harder.
