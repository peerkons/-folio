What is your best memory from Technovation?

"The best memory from Technovation is getting to know so many awesome business people.

Technovation is not just a project. It is a path that leads students to multiple opportunities and gives them an insider picture of what real business and technology look like. 

It was an amazing tool that helped me to make my career choice and provided me with the right attitude to succeed at it."
