<p>RBS Student Union stands for the interests of all Riga Business School students. We are building a strong community of leaders with the vision to leave a positive impact on society, boost its prosperity and create an influential, intelligent network between students, the University and its Alumni.

The members of the Student Union are leaded by a Presidential Couple and the Board - the main operational structure of SU. The students work voluntarily in four divisions: Education, Culture, External Relations and PR. Community is the Union's most valuable asset; therefore, every opinion matters. Together we create an encouraging in and out-of-classroom environment for successful future entrepreneurs and leaders in the world of business.</p>
